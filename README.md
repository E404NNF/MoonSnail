# **Welcome to MoonSnail**

MoonSnail is a multifunctional discord bot that is constantly being updated and improved.  
Most of the commands are admin/moderator only so far but plan to add lots of interactive and fun commands for all users. It is currently in early development so please report bugs and issues via [the GitHub](https://github.com/seasnail8169/MoonSnail/).

## **What can it do?**

MoonSnail has a fairly wide array of commands so far but do i plan to keep adding to for at least the foreseeable future. The bots default prefix is '%' can be changed with the %prefix command. The bot stores guild information using mongodb and it is written in nodejs. I am also currently developing a web dashboard for the bot which should be up soon. The domain will be [snailcorp.xyz](snailcorp.xyz).

To invite the bot to your server [click here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=750674353758142555&permissions=8&scope=bot) and authorise its permissions.
